# **About**

Welcome to the **Database-Learning-for-Data-Analysts** Repository! This repository is the culmination of my personal journey in learning effective data analysis through database management. I have diligently studied these topics through an independent study program, part of the "Kampus Merdeka" initiative, and now I aim to share the knowledge and skills I have acquired.

This repository is the product of my dedication to understanding database management deeply, especially for data analysis purposes. Each section, exercise, and concept presented here reflects my commitment to gaining expertise in this field and building a valuable portfolio for the future.

You can also find explanations about this database through the website I have created on Notion:
